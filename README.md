## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Current Story: "The Digital Portal"
Players find themselves in a mysterious room with a magical mirror and an ancient book. Through their choices, they must solve the puzzle of the digital portal and find their way through.

### How to Play
1. Follow the TwitterQuest account
2. Each tweet presents a scenario with two choices (A or B)
3. Reply to the tweet with your choice (just type A or B)
4. The next story tweet will be based on the most recent valid player choice
5. Try to reach the successful ending!

### Example Story Playthrough

Here's an example of how a story might unfold:

```
üéÆ START: You find yourself in a mysterious room. There's a dusty old book on a table and a strange mirror on the wall.
Choices:
A) Examine the book
B) Look in the mirror

Player chooses A:
üìö The book is titled 'Secrets of the Digital Realm'. As you open it, a small key falls out.
Choices:
A) Try to decode the text
B) Pick up the key

Player chooses B:
üîë You pick up the key. It's warm to the touch and seems to pulse with a faint blue light.
Choices:
A) Try it on the mirror
B) Look for a keyhole in the room

Player chooses A:
üåü The key fits perfectly! The mirror's surface becomes a swirling portal.
Congratulations, you've solved the puzzle!
```

### Story Branches
The current game includes multiple story paths:
1. The Scholar's Path
   - Focus on decoding the book
   - Discovering the mirror's secrets through knowledge
   - Understanding the symbols

2. The Explorer's Path
   - Physical interaction with objects
   - Finding the key
   - Trial and error with the mirror

3. The Observer's Path
   - Reading symbols and riddles
   - Connecting clues
   - Solving the mystery methodically

Each path leads to the same goal (activating the portal) but offers different experiences and revelations about the story world.

### Tips for Players
- Read each scenario carefully
- Consider the consequences of your choices
- Look for subtle clues in the descriptions
- Try different paths in multiple playthroughs

- Share your theories about the story
